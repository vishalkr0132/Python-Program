In Queue
insertion of elements happens at one end called 'rare end'
Delection of elements happens at another end called front end.

Peak element considers the first inserted element to the queue
we need to delete first inserted element to the queue one after another and not the last element as well middle element
Types of queues:
1. Linear queue: elements will be inserted one after another in a sequencial manner.
2. circular queue: elements are inserted one after the another in a circular manner.
                   Adding of elements is taken care of by rare 
                   Deletion of elements is taken care of by front
3. Priority queue: in this the queue works based on the priority

Operations performed on Queue data structure:
isFull(): returns True if the queue has reached its maximum size else returns False.
isEmpty():  returns True if the queue has 0 elements else returns False.     
enqueue(): It is used to add the elements to the queue.
dequeue(): it is used to remove the elements from the queue.   
peek(): it is used to return the first inserted element to the queue.
display(): it is used to display all the elements in the queue.
